hey if you want to learn about big o then you r in r8 place.
What is big O?
- This represent the time complexity of code / algorithm, i.e how much time machine will take to execute the code /algorithm.
-o(n), o(n^2), 0(2n)=>o(n).
We will go through the code and try to analyse how to find time complexity of algorithm.  For please refer to Big O/index.js file.

Types of Big(0)
** Log N run times;
